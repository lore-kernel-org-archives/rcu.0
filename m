Replying a bit late due to overseas conference travel and vacation.

When you say 'high pressure', do you mean memory pressure or just system
load?

Memory pressure slightly increases with the kfree_rcu() rework with the
benefit of much fewer grace periods.

I am not aware of a mobile usecase that benefits but there are server
workloads that make system more stable in the face of a kfree_rcu() flood.

For the KVA allocator work, I see it is quite similar to the way binder
allocates blocks. See function: binder_alloc_new_buf_locked(). Is there are
any chance to reuse any code? For one thing, binder also has an rbtree for
allocated blocks for fast lookup of allocated blocks. Does the KVA allocator
not have the need for that?

And, nice LPC presentation! I was there ;)
