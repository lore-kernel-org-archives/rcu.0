You are right, we can do additional checking for making sure its never zero.
I refreshed the patch as below, does this look Ok?

---8<-----------------------

From: "Joel Fernandes (Google)" <joel@joelfernandes.org>
Subject: [RFC v2] rcutree: Add checks for dynticks counters in

In the future we would like to combine the dynticks and dynticks_nesting
counters thus leading to simplifying the code. At the moment we cannot
do that due to concerns about usermode upcalls appearing to RCU as half
of an interrupt. Byungchul tried to do it in [1] but the
"half-interrupt" concern was raised. It is half because, what RCU
expects is rcu_irq_enter() and rcu_irq_exit() pairs when the usermode
exception happens. However, only rcu_irq_enter() is observed. This
concern may not be valid anymore, but at least it used to be the case.

Out of abundance of caution, Paul added warnings [2] in the RCU code
which if not fired by 2021 may allow us to assume that such
half-interrupt scenario cannot happen any more, which can lead to
simplification of this code.

Summary of the changes are the following:

(1) In preparation for this combination of counters in the future, we
first need to first be sure that rcu_rrupt_from_idle cannot be called
from anywhere but a hard-interrupt because previously, the comments
suggested otherwise so let us be sure. We discussed this here [3]. We
use the services of lockdep to accomplish this.

(2) Further rcu_rrupt_from_idle() is not explicit about how it is using
the counters which can lead to weird future bugs. This patch therefore
makes it more explicit about the specific counter values being tested

(3) Lastly, we check for counter underflows just to be sure these are
not happening, because the previous code in rcu_rrupt_from_idle() was
allowing the case where the counters can underflow, and the function
would still return true. Now we are checking for specific values so let
us be confident by additional checking, that such underflows don't
happen. Any case, if they do, we should fix them and the screaming
warning is appropriate. All these checks checks are NOOPs if PROVE_RCU
and PROVE_LOCKING are disabled.
