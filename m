I disagree.

Is this usage a typical hazard pointer usage, maybe not. But it's a
valid usage IMO.

The "power" of hazard pointer allows you to use it protect almost
anything, it happens to be the pointer of the object to free in the
major use cases, but as long as readers and updaters use some address in
their synchronization protocol, it's fine, because the synchronization
works.

This is more of an implementation issue, and luckily the readers in
lockdep are less frequent, so we don't have this issue at the moment.
Even if we do, there are pretty ways we can duel with it. E.g. the scan
thread can identify a "sticky" address like B, and publish it to all the
readers, so they will notify the scan thread when they finish release
it:

	hazptr_release():
	  if (steady_address != NULL && steady_address == *slot)
	    notify_scan_thread();
	  smp_store_release(slot, NULL);

in this way, scan kthread will be able to track down each reader of the
steady address (with a bitmap or something), and make the necessary
forward progress if the updater waits for too long.

And more importantly, even without this, the constant stream of readers
of B can only block a hazptr_synchronize(B), but not a
hazptr_synchronize(C), that's exactly the point of hazptr: readers don't
block the hazptr_synchronize() on other addresses.

It can be added as a slowpath as I mentioned above, surely it comes with
a cost, but it makes the API usage simpler: you can use hazptr to
protect something that is about to free and you can also use it to
protect something that your readers and updaters have agreed on an value
for synchronization.

To me it's still the same, mainly because how readers protect something.

Nope. synchronize_rcu() is too slow according to Breno's usage, and
synchronize_rcu_expedited() is way more IPI. Hope you got the conclusion
from AI, because it may lack some context here.


Don't make me wrong, if the main argument is "hey this is not a typical
hazptr usage, so we need more proper usages to upstream hazptr", then I
agree. It's just in a world where hazptr is in the kernel, such a
non-typical usage should be supported.

Thank for sharing the concern, it's valuable. If you or the AI have a
proper hazptr usage in kernel, that'll be great!
