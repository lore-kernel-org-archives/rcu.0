We do seem to be talking past each other.  ;-)

This has nothing to do with the order of events at module-unload time.

So please let me try again.

If a given srcu_struct in a module never has call_srcu() invoked, there
is no need to invoke rcu_barrier() at any time, whether at module-unload
time or not.  Adding rcu_barrier() in this case adds overhead and latency
for no good reason.

If a given srcu_struct in a module does have at least one call_srcu()
invoked, it is already that module's responsibility to make sure that
the code sticks around long enough for the callback to be invoked.

This means that correct SRCU users that invoke call_srcu() already
have srcu_barrier() at module-unload time.  Incorrect SRCU users, with
reasonable probability, now get a WARN_ON() at module-unload time, with
the per-CPU state getting leaked.  Before this change, they would (also
with reasonable probability) instead get an instruction-fetch fault when
the SRCU callback was invoked after the completion of the module unload.
Furthermore, in all cases where they would previously have gotten the
instruction-fetch fault, they now get the WARN_ON(), like this:

	if (WARN_ON(rcu_segcblist_n_cbs(&sdp->srcu_cblist)))
		return; /* Forgot srcu_barrier(), so just leak it! */

So this change already represents an improvement in usability.

							Thanx, Paul
