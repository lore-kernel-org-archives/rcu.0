For this case, where it is necessary to adjust the set of nohz_full CPUs
while the real-time workload continues running, and thus presumably also
necessary to adjust the real-time workload's set of CPUs mid-stream,
wouldn't it work better to just leave all CPUs in RCU-callbacks-offloaded
state?  Then you can adjust the nohz_full state of arbitrary CPUs without
messing with RCU.

RCU might still have some TOCTOU issues with tick_nohz_full_cpu(),
along with interesting interactions between nohz_full adjustments for
online CPUs and non-RCU portions of the kernel, but this approach would
certainly reduce the number of oddball RCU-centric race conditions that
must be addressed.

Full disclosure:  Frederic was attacking the full-up problem of switching
the RCU callback-offloading state of *online* CPUs initially, but a
continuous stream of race-condition bugs inspired the current state,
which is to allow this state to change only for offline CPUs.  But maybe
Frederic knows a new trick or two?
