Also this doesn't ask the chip to move it.

Same comments as in the nohz patch.

	for (unsigned int irq = 0; irq < total_nr_irqs; irq++) {
                struct irq_desc *desc;

                 scoped_guard(rcu)

Oh well...

So you set the affinity even on an interrupt which is shutdown?

                        guard()

That's completely broken. You _cannot_ change the affinity mask of a
managed interrupt. The mask itself is immutable.

The effective affinity can be changed by invoking the affinity setter
with the original unmodified mask. irq_do_set_affinity() already deals
with the housekeeping mask.

Also invoking irq_do_set_affinity() directly here is just wrong. It
breaks interrupts which cannot be moved in process context.

But even if that is fixed, then there is zero coordination with the
affected drivers/subsystems. Managed interrupts are related to device
and block queues and you cannot change one without the other. Neither
can you stop managed interrupts without quiescing the related device
queue. Starting them up requires also to reenable the device queue.

This problem needs to be fixed no matter what. See below.

Seriously? Why is this stuff even built when CONFIG_SMP=n?

So these validate callback seem to be just another voodoo container for
no value.

While this series might work for you by some definition of "works", it's
broken beyond repair and it's really annoying that I explained all of it
to the other people who try to solve that very same problem. Of course
you did not read any of that otherwise you would have CC'ed them.

Trying to do that without taking the CPUs mostly offline and bringing
them online again is not going to work and there is zero benefit trying
to avoid that. First of all changing the isolation is not a hotpath
operation. Doing it one by one without bringing the CPU completely down
as I outlined in the above linked mail is not much more disruptive than
trying to do all of this on the fly. If you isolate a CPU then the tasks
on that CPU which do not belong to the isolation set need to get off the
CPU anyway. If you unisolate a CPU then it's really not a problem
whether the non-isolated tasks can move on it 10 milliseconds earlier or
later.

If you want to solve all the problems related to NOHZ, managed
interrupts, RCU etc. without the hotplug machinery then you end up
replicating half of it. Don't even try to think about it, that's a
complete waste of time and won't go anywhere.

Fix the few issues which are related to hotplug that I described in the
above linked mail and use the fully correct and tested common code for
your isolation muck. Please coordinate with Waiman or whoever is working
on it at RH right now.

Thanks,
