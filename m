If you have an example of a failure to cross-reference a function that
has kerneldoc comments *that are included in the toctree*, I'd like to see
it; that's a bug.

Changing the font on functions without anything to cross-reference to is
easy enough and should probably be done; I'll look into it when I get a
chance.

Thanks,
