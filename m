Module unloading implicitly does a synchronize_rcu (for RCU-sched), and
a stop_machine. So I would be tempted to say that overhead of iteration
over all CPUs might not matter that much considering the rest.

About notifying that a call_srcu has happened for the srcu domain in a
scalable fashion, let's see... We could have a flag "call_srcu_used"
for each call_srcu domain. Whenever call_srcu is invoked, it would
load that flag. It sets it on first use.

The idea here is to only use that flag when srcu_barrier is performed
right before the srcu domain cleanup (it could become part of that
cleanup). Else, using it in all srcu_barrier() might be tricky, because
we may then need to add memory barriers or locking to the call_srcu
fast-path, which is an overhead we try to avoid.

However, if we only use that flag as part of the srcu domain cleanup,
it's already prohibited to invoke call_srcu concurrently with the
cleanup of the same domain, so I don't think we would need any
memory barriers in call_srcu.

Thoughts ?

Thanks,

Mathieu
