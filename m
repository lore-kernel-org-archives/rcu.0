What Joel said!

Plus, if you keep that CPU out of the kernel (including avoiding it ever
taking any interrupts), you won't see rcuc activity on that CPU.

Or affinity the rcu_preempt kthread elsewhere so that it is not competing
with your real-time workload.

The rcuc kthreads communicate between the corresponding CPU and the
rcu_preempt kthread (AKA RCU GP kthread).  They wake up only when there
is something for them to do, and letting your nohz_full/rcu_nocbs CPUs
execute in the kernel is an excellent way to give them something to do.

In particular, if that CPU runs in the kernel, it might have executed
an RCU read-side critical section.  Because RCU grace periods are not
permitted to complete until all pre-existing RCU read-side critical
sections finish, communication is required.

So, yes, that rcuc kthread will need to execute if its CPU queues an
RCU callback.  But it might also need to execute if some other CPU queues
an RCU callback -and- its CPU spends significant time in the kernel.
