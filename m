Thank you all.

I make sure the rcu_preempt kthread affinity was set on a non-isolated
core (as well as all unbounded rcu* threads) so I guess it is not a
competing issue.

What I=E2=80=99m running on those isolated cores are qemu/kvm vcpu tasks, a=
nd
I guess they might spend some time in the kernel=E2=80=A6 in which case I
understand it=E2=80=99s completely normal to see some rcuc activity.
And so I conclude that using isolcpus + nohz_full (which includes
rcu_nocbs) + rcu_nocb_poll + rcutree.kthread_prio is the way to go.

Thanks everyone.
