Oh, ok. I was just hypothesizing that since usermode upcalls from
something as heavy as interrupts, it could also mean we had the same from
some path that held an rcu_read_lock() as well. It was just a theoretical
concern, if it is not an issue, no problem.

The other question I had was, in which cases would dyntick_nesting in current
RCU code be > 1 (after removing the lower bit and any crowbarring) ? In the
scenarios I worked out on paper, I can only see this as 1 or 0. But the
wording of it is 'dynticks_nesting'. May be I am missing a nesting scenario?
We can exit RCU-idleness into process context only once (either exiting idle
mode or user mode). Both cases would imply a value of 1.

thanks!
