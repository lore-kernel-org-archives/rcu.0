This vmlinux linker modification is not needed. I tested without it and srcu
torture works fine with rcutorture built as a module. Putting further prints
in kernel/module.c verified that the kernel is able to find the srcu structs
just fine. You could squash the below patch into this one or apply it on top
of the dev branch.

Thanks!

Subject: [PATCH] srcu: Remove unused vmlinux srcu linker entries

The SRCU for modules optimization introduced vmlinux linker entries
which is unused since it applies only to the built-in vmlinux. So remove
it to prevent any space usage due to the 8 byte alignment.

Tested with SRCU torture_type and rcutorture.
