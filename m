So I took a shot at this trying to learn how CPU stoppers work in
relation to this problem.

I am assuming here say CPU X has entered MULTI_STOP_DISABLE_IRQ state
in multi_cpu_stop() but another CPU Y has not yet entered this state.
So CPU X is stalling RCU but it is really because of CPU Y. Now in the
problem statement, you mentioned CPU Y is not holding up the grace
period, which means Y doesn't have any of IRQ, BH or preemption
disabled ; but is still somehow stalling RCU indirectly by troubling
X.

This can only happen if :
- CPU Y has a thread executing on it that is higher priority than CPU
X's stopper thread which prevents it from getting scheduled. - but the
CPU stopper thread (migration/..) is highest priority RT so this would
be some kind of an odd scheduler bug.
- There is a bug in the CPU stopper machinery itself preventing it
from scheduling the stopper on Y. Even though Y is not holding up the
grace period.

Did I get that right? Would be exciting to run the rcutorture test
once Paul has it available to reproduce this problem.

thanks,

 - Joel
