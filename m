BTW, if there's any long code section with irq/preemption disabled, then
the problem would be not only about RCU stall. And we can also use
latency tracer or something to detect the bad situation.

So in this case, sending ipi/nmi to the CPUs where the stoppers cannot
to be scheduled does not give us additional meaningful information.

I think Paul started to think about this to solve some real problem. I
seriously love to help RCU and it's my pleasure to dig deep into kind of
RCU stuff, but I've yet to define exactly what problem is. Sorry.

Could you share the real issue? I think you don't have to reproduce it.
Just sharing the issue that you got inspired from is enough. Then I
might be able to develop 'how' with Joel! :-) It's our pleasure!

Thanks,
Byungchul
