About the last part of your email, it seems to that if after call_srcu has
returned, if the module could be unloaded on some other CPU - then it would
need to see the flag stored by the preceding call_srcu, so I believe there
would be a memory barrier between the two opreations (call_srcu and module
unload).

Also about doing the unconditional srcu_barrier, since a module could be
unloaded at any time - don't all SRCU using modules need to invoke
srcu_barrier() during their clean up anyway so we are incurring the barrier
overhead anyway? Or, am I missing a design pattern here? It seems to me
rcutorture module definitely calls srcu_barrier() before it is unloaded.
