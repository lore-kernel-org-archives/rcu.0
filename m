Most SRCU users use only synchronize_srcu(), and don't ever use
call_srcu().  Which is not too surprising given that call_srcu() showed
up late in the game.

But something still bothers me about this, and I am not yet sure
what.  One thing that seems to reduce anxiety somewhat is doing the
srcu_barrier() on all calls to cleanup_srcu_struct() rather than just
those invoked from the modules infrastructure, but I don't see why at
the moment.
