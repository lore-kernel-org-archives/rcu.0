It might be that my patch (or something like it) will be required in
addition to Tejun's fix because the current Tree SRCU code is happy
to schedule a workqueue handler on a CPU that does not even have a bit
set in the cpu_possible_mask.  This could happen on a system with the
first 50 CPUs, as in 0-49, in cpu_possible_mask.  Tree SRCU would then
be quite happy to schedule workqueue handlers on the mythical CPUs 50-63.
Which, now that I think on it, does seem a bit more brave than absolutely
warranted.  ;-)
