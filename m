We fixed the known problems this caused by turning off the VFS
functionality that the rcu pathwalks kept tripping over. See commit
7b7820b83f23 ("xfs: don't expose internal symlink metadata buffers to
the vfs").

Apart from that issue, I'm not aware of any other issues that the
XFS inode recycling directly exposes.

It assumes that the inode will not change identity during the RCU
grace period after the inode has been evicted from cache. We can
safely reinstantiate an evicted inode without waiting for an RCU
grace period as long as it is the same inode with the same content
and same state.

Problems *may* arise when we unlink the inode, then evict it, then a
new file is created and the old slab cache memory address is used
for the new inode. I describe the issue here:

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-xfs/20220118232547.GD59729@dread.disaster.area/

That said, we have exactly zero evidence that this is actually a
problem in production systems. We did get systems tripping over the
symlink issue, but there's no evidence that the
unlink->close->open(O_CREAT) issues are manifesting in the wild and
hence there hasn't been any particular urgency to address it.

What crashes are you seeing in your production environment?
