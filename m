How about as shown below?

commit 687c00c91c9edbaf5309402689bce644dd140590
Author: Paul E. McKenney <paulmck@linux.ibm.com>
Date:   Thu Apr 4 12:19:25 2019 -0700

    rcu: Use irq_work to get scheduler's attention in clean context
    
    When rcu_read_unlock_special() is invoked with interrupts disabled, is
    either not in an interrupt handler or is not using RCU_SOFTIRQ, is not
    the first RCU read-side critical section in the chain, and either there
    is an expedited grace period in flight or this is a NO_HZ_FULL kernel,
    the end of the grace period can be unduly delayed.  The reason for this
    is that it is not safe to do wakeups in this situation.
    
    This commit fixes this problem by using the irq_work subsystem to
    force a later interrupt handler in a clean environment.  Because
    set_tsk_need_resched(current) and set_preempt_need_resched() are
    invoked prior to this, the scheduler will force a context switch
    upon return from this interrupt (though perhaps at the end of any
    interrupted preempt-disable or BH-disable region of code), which will
    invoke rcu_note_context_switch() (again in a clean environment), which
    will in turn give RCU the chance to report the deferred quiescent state.
    
    Of course, by then this task might be within another RCU read-side
    critical section.  But that will be detected at that time and reporting
    will be further deferred to the outermost rcu_read_unlock().  See
    rcu_preempt_need_deferred_qs() and rcu_preempt_deferred_qs() for more
    details on the checking.
