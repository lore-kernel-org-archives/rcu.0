Agreed!

That would be good!

Nice trick on using dyntick state to check for interrupt nesting, but
wouldn't consolidating the counters break that?  But is there a lockdep
check for being in a hardware interrupt handler?  If not, could one
be added?  This would have the benefit of not adding overhead to the
scheduling-clock interrupt in production builds of the Linux kernel,
while still finding this bug in testing.

(Another approach would be to use IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_PROVE_RCU), but
a lockdep check would be cleaner.)
