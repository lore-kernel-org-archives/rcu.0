Thanks for improving the documentation!  I'll leave the RCU stuff to the
experts, but I do have one request...

Please don't put function names as literal text.  If you just say
call_rcu(), it will be formatted correctly and cross-linked to the
appropriate kerneldoc entry.  Saying ``call_rcu()`` defeats that and
clutters the plain-text reading experience.

Thanks,
