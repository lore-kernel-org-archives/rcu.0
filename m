Ah, that can happen.  Some kernels are built with CONFIG_RCU_LAZY=y, which
delays freeing in order to reduce power consumption.  And kfree_rcu()
will also delay for a bit.  But in both cases, a flood of callbacks
should get things going again.

But an isolated kfree_rcu() might well see a few seconds delay.
Saving your battery!  ;-)

Got it, thank you!
