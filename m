That is fair :-D But let me explain,

What I meant is, if we are saying that this solution has a scheduler
deadlock, then that would almost certainly imply that the existing code has
scheduler deadlock issue. Since the existing code uses the same technique
(using the deferred_qs bit in the union) to prevent the deadlock we were
discussing a few months back. If that is indeed the case, it is good to be
discussing this since we can discuss if the existing code needs any fixing as
well.

Sure I can add an example in the change log, however I was thinking of this
example which you mentioned:
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20190627173831.GW26519@linux.ibm.com/

	previous_reader()
	{
		rcu_read_lock();
		do_something(); /* Preemption happened here. */
		local_irq_disable(); /* Cannot be the scheduler! */
		do_something_else();
		rcu_read_unlock();  /* Must defer QS, task still queued. */
		do_some_other_thing();
		local_irq_enable();
	}

	current_reader() /* QS from previous_reader() is still deferred. */
	{
		local_irq_disable();  /* Might be the scheduler. */
		do_whatever();
		rcu_read_lock();
		do_whatever_else();
		rcu_read_unlock();  /* Must still defer reporting QS. */
		do_whatever_comes_to_mind();
		local_irq_enable();
	}

One modification of the example could be, previous_reader() could also do:
	previous_reader()
	{
		rcu_read_lock();
		do_something_that_takes_really_long(); /* causes need_qs in
							  the unlock_special_union to be set */
		local_irq_disable(); /* Cannot be the scheduler! */
		do_something_else();
		rcu_read_unlock();  /* Must defer QS, task still queued. */
		do_some_other_thing();
		local_irq_enable();
	}


thanks!
