Indeed, easy to forget.  ;-)

True, though it tracks user mode only in CONFIG_NO_HZ_FULL kernels.

Including NMIs, yes.

I haven't gone through it in detail, but it seems like we should be able
to treat in-kernel process-level execution like an interrupt from idle
or userspace, as the case might be.  If we did that, shouldn't we be
able to just do this?

static int rcu_is_cpu_rrupt_from_idle(void)
{
        return __this_cpu_read(rcu_data.dynticks_nmi_nesting) <= 1;
}

Yes, because these are also called from rcu_idle_enter() and
rcu_idle_exit(), which is invoked even in !NO_HZ_FULL kernels.

You got it!  ;-)

So yes, these warnings just detect the presence of misnesting.  Presumably
event tracing would then be used to track down the culprits.  Assuming that
the misnesting is reproducible and all that.
