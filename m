Very long RCU readers still result in very long RCU grace periods.  And,
after some tens of seconds, RCU CPU stall warnings.  So don't let your
RCU readers run for that long.  But you knew that already.  ;-)

Do we want to un-ignore it at the end of the grace period?  Or will that
happen automatically when it is passed to kfree()?  (My guess is that
the answer to both questions is "yes", but I figured that I should ask.)
