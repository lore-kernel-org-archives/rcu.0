We were discussing exactly this on the thread. I am going to be adding a
lockdep check to make sure the function isn't called from anywhere but an
interrupt context. Then once we can confirm that there are no more
half-interrupts in the future, we can apply your counter combining approach.

Based on the comments on the rrupt_from_idle() function, it wasn't clear to
me if the function was intended to be called from any context. That's why I
thought the counter combing approach would not work, but you are right - it
should work.

I will CC you on the lockdep check patch. Also hope you are subscribed to
the new shiny rcu@vger.kernel.org list as well :-)

thanks,

 - Joel
