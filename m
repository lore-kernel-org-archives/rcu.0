Thank you for the detailed report. I think this report is detailed 
enough to root-cause this issue, something that was not possible before 
this report.

Please help with verifying whether this patch fixes this issue: "[PATCH] 
scsi: sd: Revert "Rework asynchronous resume support"" 
(https://lore.kernel.org/linux-scsi/20220816172638.538734-1-bvanassche@acm.org/).

Thanks,

Bart.
