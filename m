If I understand you correctly, that is actually what is already done.  The
size of this dedicated section is currently set by PERCPU_MODULE_RESERVE,
and the additions of DEFINE{_STATIC}_SRCU() in modules was requiring that
this to be increased frequently.  That led to a request that something
be done, in turn leading to this patch series.

I don't see a way around this short of changing module loading to do
alloc_percpu() and then updating the relocation based on this result.
Which would admittedly be far more convenient.  I was assuming that
this would be difficult due to varying CPU offsets or the like.

But if it can be done reasonably, it would be quite a bit nicer than
forcing dynamic allocation in cases where it is not otherwise needed.
