Hi Paul and everyone,
I was thinking some more about this patch and whether we can simplify this code
much in 2021. Since 2021 is a bit far away, I thought working on it in again to
keep it fresh in memory is a good idea ;-)

To me it seems we cannot easily combine the counters (dynticks_nesting and
dynticks_nmi_nesting) even if we confirmed that there is no possibility of a
half-interrupt scenario (assuming simplication means counter combining like
Byungchul tried to do in https://goo.gl/X1U77X). The reason is because these
2 counters need to be tracked separately as they are used differently in the
following function:

static int rcu_is_cpu_rrupt_from_idle(void)
{
        return __this_cpu_read(rcu_data.dynticks_nesting) <= 0 &&
               __this_cpu_read(rcu_data.dynticks_nmi_nesting) <= 1;
}

dynticks_nesting actually tracks if we entered/exited idle or user mode.

dynticks_nmi_nesting tracks if we entered/exited interrupts.

We have to do the "dynticks_nmi_nesting <= 1" check because
rcu_is_cpu_rrupt_from_idle() can possibly be called from an interrupt itself
(like timer) so we discount 1 interrupt, and, the "dynticks_nesting <= 0"
check is because the CPU MUST be in user or idle for the check to return
true. We can't really combine these two into one counter then I think because
they both convey different messages.

The only simplication we can do, is probably the "crowbar" updates to
dynticks_nmi_nesting can be removed from rcu_eqs_enter/exit once we confirm
no more half-interrupts are possible. Which might still be a worthwhile thing
to do (while still keeping both counters separate).

However, I think we could combine the counters and lead to simplying the code
in case we implement rcu_is_cpu_rrupt_from_idle differently such that it does
not need the counters but NOHZ_FULL may take issue with that since it needs
rcu_user_enter->rcu_eqs_enter to convey that the CPU is "RCU"-idle.

Actually, I had another question... rcu_user_enter() is a NOOP in !NOHZ_FULL config.
In this case I was wondering if the the warning Paul added (in the patch I'm replying to)
will really get fired for half-interrupts. The vast majority of the systems I believe are
NOHZ_IDLE not NOHZ_FULL.
This is what a half-interrupt really looks like right? Please correct me if I'm wrong:
rcu_irq_enter()   [half interrupt causes an exception and thus rcu_irq_enter]
rcu_user_enter()  [due to usermode upcall]
rcu_user_exit()
(no more rcu_irq_exit() - hence half an interrupt)

But the rcu_user_enter()/exit is a NOOP in some configs, so will the warning in
rcu_eqs_e{xit,nter} really do anything?

Or was the idea with adding the new warnings, that they would fire the next
time rcu_idle_enter/exit is called? Like for example:

rcu_irq_enter()   [This is due to half-interrupt]
rcu_idle_enter()  [Eventually we enter the idle loop at some point
		   after the half-interrupt and the rcu_eqs_enter()
		   would "crowbar" the dynticks_nmi_nesting counter to 0].

thanks!

 - Joel
