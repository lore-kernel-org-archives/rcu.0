Hi Joel and Paul,

I always love the way to logically approach problems so I'm a fan of
all your works :) But I'm JUST curious about something here. Why can't
we combine them the way I tried even if we confirm no possibility of
half-interrupt? IMHO, the only thing we want to know through calling
rcu_is_cpu_rrupt_from_idle() is whether the interrupt comes from
RCU-idle or not - of course assuming the caller context always be an
well-defined interrupt context like e.g. the tick handler.

So the function can return true if the caller is within a RCU-idle
region except a well-known single interrupt nested.

Of course, now that we cannot confirm it yet, the crowbar is necessary.
But does it still have a problem even after confirming it? Why? What am
I missing? Could you explain why for me? :(

Thanks,
Byungchul
