I think we are not expressing quite the same idea.

AFAIU, yours is to have DEFINE*_SRCU directly define per-cpu data within modules,
which ends up using percpu module reserved memory.

My idea is to make DEFINE*_SRCU have a different behavior under #ifdef MODULE.
It could emit a _global variable_ (_not_ per-cpu) within a new section. That
section would then be used by module init/exit code to figure out what "srcu
descriptors" are present in the modules. It would therefore rely on dynamic
allocation for those, therefore removing the need to involve the percpu module
reserved pool at all.

Hopefully my explanation above helps clear out what I have in mind.

You can find similar tricks performed by include/linux/tracepoint.h:

#ifdef CONFIG_HAVE_ARCH_PREL32_RELOCATIONS
static inline struct tracepoint *tracepoint_ptr_deref(tracepoint_ptr_t *p)
{
        return offset_to_ptr(p);
}

#define __TRACEPOINT_ENTRY(name)                                        \
        asm("   .section \"__tracepoints_ptrs\", \"a\"          \n"     \
            "   .balign 4                                       \n"     \
            "   .long   __tracepoint_" #name " - .              \n"     \
            "   .previous                                       \n")
#else
static inline struct tracepoint *tracepoint_ptr_deref(tracepoint_ptr_t *p)
{
        return *p;
}

#define __TRACEPOINT_ENTRY(name)                                         \
        static tracepoint_ptr_t __tracepoint_ptr_##name __used           \
        __attribute__((section("__tracepoints_ptrs"))) =                 \
                &__tracepoint_##name
#endif

[...]

#define DEFINE_TRACE_FN(name, reg, unreg)                                \
        static const char __tpstrtab_##name[]                            \
        __attribute__((section("__tracepoints_strings"))) = #name;       \
        struct tracepoint __tracepoint_##name                            \
        __attribute__((section("__tracepoints"), used)) =                \
                { __tpstrtab_##name, STATIC_KEY_INIT_FALSE, reg, unreg, NULL };\
        __TRACEPOINT_ENTRY(name);

And kernel/module.c:

find_module_sections():

#ifdef CONFIG_TRACEPOINTS
        mod->tracepoints_ptrs = section_objs(info, "__tracepoints_ptrs",
                                             sizeof(*mod->tracepoints_ptrs),
                                             &mod->num_tracepoints);
#endif

And kernel/tracepoint.c:tracepoint_module_notify() for the module coming/going
notifier.

Basically you would want to have your own structure within your own section of
the module which describes the srcu domain, and have a module coming/going
notifier responsible for dynamically allocating the srcu domain on "coming", and
doing a srcu barrier and cleanup the domain on "going".
