In general, yes, which is fine (famous last words) for normal grace
periods but not so good for expedited grace periods.

Agreed, and I believe that transitioning to usermode execution also
gives the scheduler a chance to take action.

The one exception to this is when a nohz_full CPU running in nohz_full
mode does a system call that decides to execute for a very long time.
Last I checked, the scheduling-clock interrupt did -not- get retriggered
in this case, and the delay could be indefinite, as in bad even for
normal grace periods.

But wouldn't the current use of set_tsk_need_resched(current) followed by
set_preempt_need_resched() work just as well in that case?  The scheduler
would react to these at the next scheduler-clock interrupt on their
own, right?  Or am I being scheduler-naive again?
