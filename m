The easiest way to do this is just creating the initial workers for all
possible pools. Please see below. However, the downside is that it's going
to create all workers for all possible cpus. This isn't a problem for
anybody else but these IBM mainframes often come up with a lot of possible
but not-yet-or-ever-online CPUs for capacity management, so the cost may not
be negligible on some configurations.

IBM folks, is that okay?

Also, why do you need to queue work items on an offline CPU? Do they
actually have to be per-cpu? Can you get away with using an unbound
workqueue?

Thanks.

Subject: workqueue: Create workers for all possible CPUs on init

Per-CPU worker pools are initialized for every possible CPU during early boot,
but workqueue_init() only creates initial workers for online CPUs. On systems
where possible CPUs outnumber online CPUs (e.g. s390 LPARs with 76 online and
400 possible CPUs), the pools for never-onlined CPUs have POOL_DISASSOCIATED
set but no workers. Any work item queued on such a CPU hangs indefinitely.

This was exposed by 61bbcfb50514 ("srcu: Push srcu_node allocation to GP when
non-preemptible") which made SRCU schedule callbacks on all possible CPUs
during size transitions, triggering workqueue lockup warnings for all
never-onlined CPUs.

Create workers for all possible CPUs during init, not just online ones. For
online CPUs, the behavior is unchanged - POOL_DISASSOCIATED is cleared and the
worker is bound to the CPU. For not-yet-online CPUs, POOL_DISASSOCIATED
remains set, so worker_attach_to_pool() marks the worker UNBOUND and it can
execute on any CPU. When the CPU later comes online, rebind_workers() handles
the transition to associated operation as usual.
