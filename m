I'm going to pick it up.

It can use it, it is recommended to do so and to move those threads out
of the CPU(s) that are dedicated for RT workload. But then there are
those with a single CPU.

It depends. RT as of now. The softirq can be preempted this includes the
RCU softirq. That means that a wakeup of a high priority RT task can
preempt the RCU softirq. So this might not be an issue.
the softirq takes a global per-CPU lock which means we can only have one
softirq vector running at a time (we used to have the possibility of
multiple vectors running in parallel but that is gone now). So this
enforces the behaviour we have in !RT as of today.  If you rely on
"timely" executed softirq then long running RCU-softirq might be bad for
you. But so is everything else that might cause long running softirqs.

What I don't know is how RCU-boosting and preempted softirq works.
