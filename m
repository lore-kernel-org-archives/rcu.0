I think that would work only if this function is always called from an
interrupt:

The comments on this function says:
 * If the current CPU is idle or running at a first-level (not nested)
 * interrupt from idle, return true.  The caller must have at least
 * disabled preemption.
 */

According to this comment rcu_is_cpu_rrupt_from_idle can be called from
somewhere other than an interrupt although from code-reading that does not
seem to be.

If it is ever possible to call rcu_is_cpu_rrupt_from_idle from anywhere but
an interrupt, then we would have a scenario like:
rcu_eqs_exit()   (Called say from rcu_idle_exit)
rcu_is_cpu_rrupt_from_idle  (now nesting counter is 1, so the <=1 check
                             returns true).

This would result in the function falsely claiming the CPU was idle from an
RCU standpoint I think.

However both from testing and from code reading, I don't see such a scenario
happening. Could we be more explicit in the code that this function can only
be called from an interrupt, and also we change the code comment to be more
clear about it (like the following diff)?

I made the following change and it didn't seem to blow up and also makes the
code more clear. The only change I would make if we were considering merging
this is to change the BUG_ON to WARN_ON_ONCE but I want to check first if you
think this change is useful to do. I think being explicit about the intention
is a good thing. I also specifically check for first-level of interrupt
nesting (==1).
