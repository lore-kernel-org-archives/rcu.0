When you say "callbacks arrive after the module text has gone",
I think you assume that free_module() is invoked before the
MODULE_STATE_GOING notifiers are called. But it's done in the
opposite order: going notifiers are called first, and then
free_module() is invoked.

So AFAIU it would be safe to issue the srcu_barrier() from the module
going notifier.

Or am I missing something ?

Thanks,

Mathieu
