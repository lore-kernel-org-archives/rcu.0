First, thank you for reviewing this!

The "why" is because people normally don't do things like the code
sequence shown below, but where the scheduler holds locks across the
second RCU read-side critical section.  (If they did, lockdep would
complain.  Nevertheless, it is good to avoid this potential problem.)

Yes, PREEMPT=y.  It happens like this:

1.	rcu_read_lock() with everything enabled.

2.	Preemption then resumption.

3.	local_irq_disable().

4.	rcu_read_unlock().

5.	local_irq_enable().

From what I know, the scheduler doesn't see anything until the next
interrupt, local_bh_enable(), return to userspace, etc.  Because this
is PREEMPT=y, preempt_enable() and cond_resched() do nothing.  So
it could be some time (milliseconds, depending on HZ, NO_HZ_FULL, and
so on) until the scheduler responds.  With NO_HZ_FULL, last I knew,
the delay can be extremely long.

Or am I missing something that gets the scheduler on the job faster?

Hmmm...  If your point is that this amount of delay matters only for
expedited grace periods, you are quite right.  So perhaps I shouldn't be
doing any of the expensive stuff unless there is an expedited grace period
in flight.  Or if NO_HZ_FULL.  See below for an updated (and untested)
patch to this effect.

On the first round, without the ->deferred_qs, we know the scheduler
cannot be holding any of its pi or rq locks because if it did, it would
have disabled interrupts across the entire RCU read-side critical section.
Wakeups are therefore safe in this case, whether via softirq or wakeup.
Afterwards, we don't have that guarantee because an earlier critical
section might have been preempted and the scheduler might have held one
of its locks across the entire just-ended critical section.

And I believe you are right that we should avoid the wakeups unless
there is an expedited grace period in flight or in a NO_HZ_FULL kernel.
Hence the patch shown below.

							Thanx, Paul
